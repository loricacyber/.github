# Lorica Cybersecurity

**AI that builds secure systems. Infrastructure that makes it automatic.**

Lorica is building AI-native infrastructure to make privacy-preserving systems as easy to deploy as any modern AI application.  
We’re combining foundation models with encrypted computation to eliminate the complexity of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) — so developers can go from idea to secure deployment in minutes, not months.

## 🔧 What We’re Building

We’re training foundation models that **natively understand and orchestrate encrypted computation**, enabling:

- **Automated PET workflows** — AI that composes secure configurations, pipelines, and infrastructure across confidential computing, FHE, MPC, and more
- **Composable privacy tooling** — PET-aware code generation tailored to your app, data, and threat model
- **Developer-first deployment** — deploy private systems using a single API or CLI command

Behind the scenes, we unify siloed PETs into a coherent stack — abstracting away cryptographic and infrastructure pain.

## 🚀 Why It Matters

PETs have matured — but adoption is stuck. They’re fragmented, slow, and designed for experts.

Lorica changes that by:

- Slashing time-to-deployment from months to minutes
- Letting developers deploy encrypted systems without needing cryptography expertise
- Bringing AI-native automation to security workflows that haven’t evolved in decades

In a world where **privacy, compliance, and national security** are at odds with AI acceleration, Lorica provides a third path: systems that are **fast, private, and programmable by design**.

## 🌍 Who It’s For

- **AI teams** deploying sensitive models in regulated or sovereign environments
- **Enterprises** building zero-trust or privacy-first infrastructure
- **Researchers & engineers** designing next-gen encrypted workflows
- **Governments & defense** building high-assurance AI systems with strict data controls
